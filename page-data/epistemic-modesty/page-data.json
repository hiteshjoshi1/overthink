High performance and poor performance both regress to the mean. So taper your expectations from companies, from your children and the world at large when they are doing good and be optimistic when they are doing bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"algorithms-are-better-than-us-in-most-cases\"><a href=\"#algorithms-are-better-than-us-in-most-cases\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Algorithms are better than us in most cases</h2>\n<p>Well, this is not about computers beating human grandmasters in Chess or AI taking over. But about our fallibility as decission makers. Humans are loss averse, emotional and unpredictable. No human is a rational agent. We do not follow the laws we have made for ourselves. We are terrible in predicting outcomes, have many documented and unknown biases. We often ignore the base case in estimation in the name of a gut feeling.\nIt is better to use algorithms to make important decisions. This not only means programmed algorithms, but also following a sequence of predefined steps to arrive at a decision. </p>\n<p>Example, while interviewing a new hire, score her at different predetermined parameters (Technical competence, Communication, Empathy, Culture fit). These parameters could have pre determined weight in calculating the final score.
