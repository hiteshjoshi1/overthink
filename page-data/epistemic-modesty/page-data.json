We all have a set of beliefs about how the world works.  Sometimes we have thought about these beliefs, examined them and sometimes we have just assimiliated them through societal norms.  Our world view ranges from incomplete to downright wrong in most cases. And that is why we need the intellectual modesty to acknowledge the limits of our knowledge, examine our belief system regularly and change it if it is wrong.  </p>\n<p>Socrates again popped into my head and said</p>\n<p> <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;An unexamined life is not worth living&quot;</code></p>\n<p>Here I am going to define some of the ideas, mental models that I find worth learning, practising and internalising.</p>\n<h2 id=\"avoid-ruin-situations\"><a href=\"#avoid-ruin-situations\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Avoid ruin situations</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">A lot of success in business and in life comes from knowing what you want to avoid - Charlie Munger</code></p>\n<p>Let’s start with what to avoid.

That is we are more motivated to avoid losses than to achieve gains. Trying to avoid losses can make us do outright stupid things. Like averaging an asset when the decission of buying it in the first place was either stupid or wrong. Understanding sunk costs is important here.\nExpending a good asset(money, time, emotions) after a bad asset is a recipe of disaster. </p>\n<p> <code class=\"language-text\">Losses are inevitable</code> so we try to win the WAR not every battle.</p>\n<p>It is however important to <code class=\"language-text\">Know the difference between bad decisions and bad outcomes</code>\nA good decission can have a bad outcome. A bad decission can sometimes have a good outcome if we are lucky. We should consciously evaluate our decissions and if a good decission lead to a bad outcome, that is life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"avoiding-hedonistic-treadmills\"><a href=\"#avoiding-hedonistic-treadmills\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Avoiding hedonistic treadmills</h2>\n<p>With internet, gaming, social media, content streaming services we are running on hedonistic treadmills which give us regular shots of dopamine and serotonin.  Content is crafted very cleverly to keep us engaged in perpetuity. Content these days is like a well made candy with the right mix of salt and sugar that never really satiates you.\nThis is a form of escapism, a way to avoid questions that our inner voice keeps asking. You can live your entire life avoiding it but I wager that won’t be a very satisfying life. It is ok to not have answers. It is ok to not live upto every ideal. Get comfortable with discomfort, learn to enjoy free time, your own company, your relationships. </p>\n<h2 id=\"act-now\"><a href=\"#act-now\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Act Now</h2>\n<p>If there is a problem in life (of health, relationship, business, career or investing) the time to act is now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You realized that you are neglecting your health - act now. </li>\n<li>You realized that you are neglecting your relationships, apologize and make up for it - now.</li>\n<li>You made an asset purchase that was a mistake, own it up and book loss - now.</li>\n<li>A personal habit is dragging you down, quit it.

High performance and poor performance both regress to the mean. So taper your expectations from companies, from your children and the world at large when they are doing good and be optimistic when they are doing bad. And most importantly forecast the future keeping effects of regression in mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-algorithms-in-your-life\"><a href=\"#use-algorithms-in-your-life\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Use algorithms in your life</h2>\n<p>Humans can be emotional, unpredictable, irrational, loss averse and greedy. No human is a rational agent. We do not even follow the laws we have made for ourselves. We are affected by our moods, herd mentality and social norms. We are terrible in predicting outcomes, we have many documented and undocumented biases.</p>\n<p>We can use algorithms to aid us in making important decisions. This not only means using computer code to help us, but also following a sequence of predefined steps to arrive at a decision. </p>\n<p>Example, while interviewing a new hire, score him at different predetermined parameters (Technical competence, Communication, Empathy, Culture fit etc). These parameters could have pre determined weight in calculating the final score. Assign weights individually and calculate overall score. If the overall score is higher than a preset cutoff hire the applicant. </p>\n<h2 id=\"social-proof-and-its-effects\"><a href=\"#social-proof-and-its-effects\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Social Proof and its effects</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">When all think alike, no one thinks very much.</code>\n- Walter Lippman</p>\n<p>Social proof is valuable. We want to do know what our brethren is doing. Life has been so much better now that we have product reviews for almost everything we buy. We need to examine the behavior of groups and be on guard against herd mentality. There is a serious flaw in the argument that says if so many people are doing it, it must be right. In matters of great importance, examine the social proof and then make your own decision.</p>","timeToRead":6,"frontmatter":{"title":"Epistemic Modesty","date":"March 10, 2020","updatedate":"June 22, 2021","spoiler":"Do you have it?","version":1.2},"fields":{"slug":"/epistemic-modesty/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/epistemic-modesty/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/corona-virus/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"corona-virus"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Impact of Corona Virus"}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
