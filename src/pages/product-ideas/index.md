What makes a great product? Something that creates VALUE for others.  
If a product saves you time, increases your convenience, decreases your inconveniece, help you make a more informed decission or in general helps you do something better that you already want to do, I am in a sweet spot product wise.

Identifying such sweet spots where there is a product-market fit is hard. But there are some ideas that may help.


Think and write about who will use your product and why? 
What value it brings to them?
What other options do they have or could consider before buying to your product?
When you see blindspots or grey areas in your vision, learn about them, revise your model.


 
That depends on the context of what you are building. The only caveat here is that you should know who you are targeting and don't change the target users. For example, a restuarant that sells Sushi sashimi on one day and Indian paanipuri on the next day won't do well. 

2. Alter your 




How to find or create such value?
I think there are very few people who are lucky enough to come out with breakthrough ideas from the start. Ideas do not amount to much on their own. A company needs to couple a good idea with a very strong execution and focus on customer needs to create value. The idea itself will change shape, crystallize or morph into something else with execution, user feedback.

What it means to have a good idea?
Idea or a strategy of value creation for the end user should be well articulated. I am not talking about business plan here. I am talking about how you plan to create value by starting a new service(Spotify), create a new market(AWS, Netflix) or revolutionize how people commute (Uber, Lyft, Grab etc). The business plan will fall in place if you are creating enough user demand. Sometimes a product will have paying customers on Day 1 and you may be breaking even in first 3 months and sometimes you will have to seed the ecosystem for years before you see a sliver of profit.

It is important to have a well articulated vision of the value product is delivering. Articulated knowledge translates to mission statements where unarticulated knowledge leads to perverse incentives and wastage of resources.
