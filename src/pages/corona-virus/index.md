*In hindsight, most of the predictions here proved right. But I missed the biggest prediction of them all. The quantitative easing/stimulus for pandemic and its affect on assets prices across countries and asset classes. Did I benefit enough from the insights below? Probably not. One thing is for certain, the writing style in this piece sucked.*


### 1. Volatility and FUD in stock markets and in crypto.
I love acronmys and Fear, Uncertaninity, and Doubt (FUD) is one of my favorites. Lets remember - do not try to time the markets. Do not predict. Do not put your life savings into it. If you are sitting on cash invest in companies with cash in balance sheets, solid management and decent P/E.
Book losses in companies whose operating performance have worsened and you were just holding.  

### 2. Increased Netflix sales, new users joining in.
If you have the dough, buy in.
### 3. Increased Amazon, Alibaba, Lazada, Flipkart sales, people buying more remotely.
Buy shares of these companies in dips.
### 4. Increased book sales/ Kindle sales.
May be just wishful thinking.
### 5. Wipe out of some hotels, closure of some restaurants
If you hold some hotel stocks,resturant chains, it is time to sell.
### 6. Airlines needing bailouts or running huge losses.
Same with airlines, sector as a whole has always been risky now doubly so.
### 7. Companies that operate movie theatres, theme parks or malls staring at their worst quarters ahead.
Sell off is imminent, no matter how much people in your country love movies and theatres. No matter how good theme parks are. No footfalls no revenue.
### 8. Increase in unemployment as business activity slows down and hiring slows down.
Learn to blog, teach, it is high time to find alternative income streams, ideally passive.
### 9. Utility companies like railroads/trains getting impacted.
They have not gone down as much as they should, further correction is very likely.
### 10. Catering companies or wholesellers to airline or railroad industry impacted
Look out for bargains.
### 11. Insurance companies mixed impact- high cover costs followed by new subscriptions
Immediate impact high. This should drag valuations.
### 12. Life insurance premiums shooting up.
### 13. Increased government spending. Worsening fiscal deficit
With US fed interest rates nearly zero, I dont see what tools we have as global economy to withstand this crisis economically. At some point we have to take working remote as business as usual and carry on for a while.
### 14. Hospital chains/ Hospital operators might benefit.
Unfortunate for humans but this is increased business for healthcare providers.
### 15. Rise in consumption/usage of contraceptives
What to do with all that free time after you have binge watched every good show on Netflix.But seriously good time to buy companies producing contraceptives and the like.
### 16. Rise in at-home consumption, good or neutral for FMCG companies.
If you can get FMCG companies in decent P/E, unleverage balance sheets and a decent product moat, buy buy buy.
### 17. Rise in number of students joining online learning platforms - khanacademy
Overall very positive , specially for countries like India. Online learning content is great, far better then what has been taught in schools. This shift is required.
### 18. Rise in furniture sales/ computer peripherals as many work remote for the first time.
### 19. Drop in liqour sales - people like to drink in social situations.
### 20. Drop in music concerts, company conferences
### 21. School/ college closures - impact on education
### 22. Impact on Uber, Grab, Lyft, Didi etc and their driving partners.
### 23. Drop in global GDP, this might even create a recession.
### 24. Increased isolation, depression and the like.
### 25. Discretionary spending going down- tourism, IT, consumer durables etc.
### 26. Impact on handshakes
Some people, I hope many will use this as an excuse to completely do away with handshakes. I prefer to switch to Namaste.Fist bump , elbow bump is an ok compromise too. It is time we let go off this unsanitary custom.
