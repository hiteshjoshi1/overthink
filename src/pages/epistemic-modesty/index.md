```
Epistemic - “relating to knowledge or to the degree of its validation”  
```
Fancy word, isn’t it? 

I heard the phrase first from Tyler Cowen, when Shane Parish(fs.blog) interviewed him for his podcast.  Fancy language aside, the idea is simple and centuries old. 

Socrates said -

 ```"The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing."```

We all have a world view, a set of beliefs, mental models. Sometimes these beliefs are carefully choosen by us, sometimes they are assimiliated through social norms and sometimes we don't even know we have them and how we got them.
Like any kind of knowledge, our world view is almost always incomplete. Modesty is needed to acknowledge that there are and always will be gaps in one's knowledge. If you want to learn and grow, accepting the limits of your current knowledge is not enough. We need to go a step further and be open to change our thinking, knowledge, world view whenever we receive evidence contrary to our beliefs. 

It is however necessary to consciously formulate a world view that helps us navigate the complexities of modern life. In this article I am trying to define the foundational mental models that I find most appealing right now. I hope to enlarge, add and edit  this list as I grow and learn.

Starting with what to avoid -
## Take Action NOW
If there is a problem in life (of health, relationship, business, career or investing), the time to act is NOW.
You realized that you are neglecting your health - act now. You realized that you are neglecting your relationships, apologize now and make up for it. You made a disastrous investment, own it up and book losses - live to fight another day. A personal habit is dragging you down, quit now  cold turkey.

## Avoid ruin situations
```A lot of success in business and in life comes from knowing what you want to avoid - Charlie Munger```

Anything that ruins your health(drugs, diseases). More importantly anything that ruins your reputation, stay miles away. Reputation is far more important than money, it is built slowly and is lost in a second. In all dealings in life, you should never have to ask the question is this legal?
Avoid people you do not respect or have questionable ethics. Remember there is always collateral damage.
Always remember elementary math, a billion multiplied by zero is still zero.

## Avoiding hedonistic treadmills
With abundance of food and now the internet , we are running on hedonistic treadmills which give us regular shots of dopamine and serotonin.  Streaming services, social media, mobile games, online shopping are cleverly crafted mechanisms to keep you engaged in perpetuity. We often neglect what is important because binge watching that latest episode or tweeting yet another update feels so good.  
Live consciously and try to avoid these treadmills because it is very hard to get off once you are on it.

## Compounding
Remember the power of compounding and use it for your good. 
Compounding for learning
Read more, learn more, and as you read more the benefits that you reap won’t just add up, they compound.

### Compounding of money/ investment
The most straightforward and measurable of them all.

### Compounding for Health
We don’t deposit money in a fixed deposit and take it out on the next day. The same is with a daily regimen, exercise, healthy diet or yoga. Do it daily and let the effects compound.

### Compounding for relationships
If you deposit consistently in your relationships by being there, they will compound. If you don’t they will wither away, sometimes slowly and often completely.

### Be on the right side of compounding
Compounding, as all great forces have a dark side too, it will work against you if you are on the wrong side of it. All negative things compound too and often their rate of compounding is significantly higher then anything positive. Beware of negative compounding effects on your health, relationships and reputation. 

## Keep losses in the right perspective

Given that losses loom larger than wins in human psyche, loss avoidance can make you do stupid things.If you have the right mental constitution, FUD(fear, uncertainty and doubt) is your friend.
Remember “Losses are inevitable” so try focussing on Winning the WAR not every battle.
It is also important to “Know the difference between bad decisions and bad outcomes.” There is a significant difference between a bad decision in light of facts and a good decision that happened to have a bad outcome.

## Use Consistency Principle to your advantage

```“A man uses his  behavior to tell him about himself. It is one of the primary source of beliefs, values and attitudes” - Robert Cialdini(paraphrased) ``` 

We form a self image consistent with our actions. If you want to change the way you think about yourself, start associating with a new identity even when you are not actually there. 
You will initially feel like a fraud but your mind will actually start building a new self image which is consistent with your new actions and before you know your behavior will change and the adopted identity becomes the new normal. This is called consistency principle of self image.

Consistency principle works on the dark side too, associate with stupid things, bad behavior and your self image will deteriorate and you will start to believe that you are actually worthless.

## Regression to the mean
Things regress to the mean, they always do. High performance and poor performance both regress to the mean. So taper your expectations from companies, from your children and the world at large when they are doing good and be optimistic when they are doing bad. And most importantly forecast the future keeping regression and its effects in mind.

## Algorithms are better than us in most cases
Well, this is not about computers beating human grandmasters in Chess or AI taking over. But about our fallibility as decission makers. Humans are loss averse, emotional and unpredictable. No human is a rational agent. We do not follow the laws we have made for ourselves. We are terrible in predicting outcomes, have many documented and unknown biases. We often ignore the base case and regression in estimating things in the name of a gut feeling.
It is better to use algorithms to make important decisions. This not only means programmed algorithms, but also following a sequence of predefined steps to arrive at a decision. 

Example, while interviewing a new hire, score her at different predetermined parameters (Technical competence, Communication, Empathy, Culture fit). These parameters could have pre determined weight in calculating the final score. The algorithm calculates the final score and if the interviewee’s final score crosses a threshold, hire her.

## Social Proof and its effects
```When all think alike, no one thinks very much.```
    - Walter Lippman

Social proof is valuable. Life would be too hard without it, but herd mentality is dangerous. There is a serious flaw in the reasoning that says if so many people are doing it , it must be right. 
In matters of great importance, moral or financial, examine the social proof and make your own decisions.


## Know your circle of competence and pound away
We often do not play to our strengths and build on our innate talents and competencies. Try to find work, any work which does not feel like work and then pound away.
